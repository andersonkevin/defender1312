### Testing (tests/test_network_scanner.py, etc.)
You can add test cases using `unittest` or `pytest` to validate each function in `network_scanner.py`, `intrusion_detection.py`, and `utils.py`.

### Next Steps
1. **Create the repository on GitHub**: Initialize a new GitHub repository and upload these files.
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated testing with GitHub Actions to run your unit tests.
3. **Documentation**: Enhance the README with detailed usage instructions, examples, and explanations.

This structure will make your project easier to manage, extend, and collaborate on. Let me know if you'd like any further assistance with this setup!
